#summary Some format rules on JSON documents in jsonengine

= JSON Document Format =

jsonengine can handle any kind of JSON documents, with the following rules.

== Auto indexing for query ==

Any properties with literal value (i.e. string, boolean and number) will be added to the jsonengine's internal index, so that the document can be filtered or sorted by the property on queries.

== Special properties ==

The following properties are handled specially in jsonengine:

  * *`_`docId*: an unique ID of each JSON document. 
  * *`_`updatedAt*: a long value of timestamp when the JSON document has been updated.
  * *`_`<any property name>*: if you put any property name starts with "`_`", the property will not be added to the index.
  * These rules will not be applied to any child JSON documents.
