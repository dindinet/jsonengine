#summary How to use query on jsonengine

== Example query ==

{{{
/GET /_q/myDoc?cond=age.ge.20&cond=age.lt.60&sort=age.asc&limit=10
}}}

This query would return an array of JSON documents that satisfies:

  * docType is "myDoc".
  * "age" property is greater or equal to 20 and less than 60.
  * Sorted by "age" property in ascending order.
  * Number of returned documents will be limited to 10.

== Query URI format ==

You can issue simple queries on jsonengine with the following request format:

{{{
/GET /_q/<docType>[?<queryFilter>{&<queryFilter>}]
}}}

where `[`?`<`queryFilter`>``{`&`<`queryFilter`>``}``]` means you can write 0 or more `<`queryFilter`>` as query string on the URI. `<`queryFilter`>` is defined below.

{{{
<queryFilter> = <condFilter> | <sortFilter> | <limitFilter>

<condFilter> = cond=<propertyName>.<comparator>.<propertyValue>
<comparator> = eq | lt | le | gt | ge 

<sortFilter> = sort=<propertyName>.<sortOrder>
<sortOrder> = asc | desc

<limitFilter> = limit=<integer>
}}}

== Restrictions ==

  * Only one kind of `<`propertyName`>` can be used in one query URI. e.g. You can not use "age" property and "name" property at the same time.
  * You may put `<`condFilter`>` 0 to 2 times. Two `<`condFilter`>`s will be combined by AND operation.
  * You may put `<`sortFilter`>` and `<`limitFilter`>` 0 to 1 times.
  * The URI should be URL encoded.
