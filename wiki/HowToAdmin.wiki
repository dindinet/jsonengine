#summary How to admin jsonengine.

= How to admin jsonengine =

Once you have installed your jsonengine, you can access to the jsonengine admin page with the following URL:

 * http://my-appid.appspot.com/_admin/

On the admin page, you can use the tabs described below.

== Security tab ==

On the Security tab, you can add, edit or delete an access level setting for each docType. The setting includes both "Access Level for Read" and "Access Level for Write" for each docType. The "Read" means the get and the query access and the "Write" means the put and the delete access.

For both read and write operations, you can choose one of the following access level:

 * "public": anyone can access to the operation without any authentication.
 * "protected" : An user who have been authenticated (by Google account or OpenID) can access to the operation.
 * "private" : An user who have been authenticated (by Google account or OpenID) and is the owner of the Doc can access to the operation.
 * "admin" : Only the administrator can access to the operation.

Please be noted that the "public" docType can be accessed by anyone on the internet. It is strongly recommend not to use the "public" level on write operation as it would allow anyone to store their data on your jsonengine without any limit.

== Test tab ==

On the Test tab, you can start a series of unit tests.

=== External Testing ===

By pressing the "Start External Testing" button at the bottom of the screen, the script inside the testing page will issue a series of test requests to the server and check if the results are correct. By confirming that the test finishes with green bar, it is assured that your jsonengine is working properly on the cloud environment.

The script inside the jsonengine on the cloud will issue a series of test request to itself and check if the results are correct. The green bar indicates the jsonengine is working properly.
