#summary How to admin jsonengine.

= How to admin jsonengine =

Once you have installed your jsonengine, you can access to the jsonengine admin page with the following URL:

 * http://my-appid.appspot.com/_admin/

On the admin page, you can use the tabs described below.

== Security tab ==

In order to use jsonengine, you have to add an access level setting for each docType you use. On the Security tab, you can add, edit or delete an access level setting for each docType. The setting includes both "Access Level for Read" and "Access Level for Write" for each docType. The "Read" means the get and the query access and the "Write" means the put and the delete access.

For both read and write operations, you can choose one of the following access level:

|| Access Level || Who can read? (get and query) || Who can write? (put and delete) ||
|| public ||  Anyone || Anyone ||
|| protected || User || User ||
|| private || Owner || User can put a new Doc, Owner can update or delete a Doc ||
|| admin || Administrator || Administrator ||

 * Anyone: any user who access to jsonengine without authentication.
 * User: An user authenticated by either Google account or Open ID.
 * Owner: The owner of the Doc.
 * Administrator: The administrator of your appid.

The "public" docType can be accessed by anyone on the internet. It is strongly recommend not to use the "public" level on write operation as it would allow anyone to store their data on your jsonengine without any limit.

== Test tab ==

On the Test tab, you can start a series of unit tests.

=== External Testing ===

By pressing the "Start External Testing" button at the bottom of the screen, the script inside the testing page will issue a series of test requests to the server and check if the results are correct. By confirming that the test finishes with green bar, it is assured that your jsonengine is working properly on the cloud environment.
